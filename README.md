This is a GUI Retirement Saving calculator/Planner I implemented when I was in UR. After the user filled in all the JTextFields, they should press the button "draw the chart" and it will call ActionListener to get all the filled in information and calculate them into accumulated savings over the years. What I used was creating a double array with an index of living years, and then storing each year's accum savings into each index. I call repaint() to draw the bar chart. The bars will be happy green for the positive savings and will be sad red for the negative savings(deficits). Because I am afraid of making the markings too crowded and ugly, so I decided to only mark the maximum savings and the ending savings. And after I press the "draw the chart" button, a new button will appear, if the user presses it, all the detailed accumulated savings data will be shown with years on the JOptionPane. For elegant design, I added music and floral decoration.


I did research on those websites, here I give credits for them.
